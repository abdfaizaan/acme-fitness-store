# Modernize Java Apps

### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to build and deploy both frontend and backend Spring applications to Azure Spring Apps. Starting with a basic hello-world Spring Boot app, you'll progress to deploying the ACME-FITNESS demo application, configuring Spring Cloud Gateway, and verifying frontend and backend access. You will modify Spring Cloud Gateway rules to enable communication with the Application Configuration Service and Service Registry. Additionally, you'll configure Single Sign-On using Microsoft Entra ID and connect applications to persistent stores, utilizing Azure Key Vault for secure secret and key management. The lab will also cover managing SSL/TLS certificates, enforcing role-based access policies, and monitoring application health through live metrics and logs. Lastly, you'll implement rate limiting for your APIs using Spring Cloud Gateway filters.

## Objectives

- Deploy and Build Applications
- Configure Single Sign-On
- Integrate with Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure Cache for Redis
- Load Application Secrets using Key Vault
- Monitor Applications End-to-End (Optional)
- Change the Application Code and Set Request Rate Limit (Optional)
- Automate from idea to production
- Infuse AI into Fitness Store
